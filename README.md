# ✨ CommunityKit 2025 — Feature List ✨
> A celebration of the incredible apps crafted for **OS 26** and beyond.

---

## 🎉 Welcome!
The 2025 **CommunityKit Release Feature List** is your stage to share what you’ve built this year.  
Whether your app is shimmering with **Liquid Glass**, powered by **Foundation Models**, chiming with **AlarmKit**, or simply refined with a thoughtful update — we want to celebrate **all of it**.

Because sometimes the most powerful thing you can do for your users isn’t adopting the latest framework — it’s releasing an update that makes life better, smoother, and more joyful. 🌱
